For additional information, see the [Model Card paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf).

## Model Details
Provide a brief summary of the model’s structure and parameters (e.g., RandomForestClassifier with certain hyperparameters).

## Intended Use
Explain the intended use cases for the model (e.g., predicting if an individual’s income is `<=50K` or `>50K` based on census attributes).

## Training Data
Describe the census dataset used (source, size, features, and relevant preprocessing steps).

## Evaluation Data
Indicate how the dataset was split for training vs. testing, as well as any additional validation data used.

## Metrics
Include the metrics used (F1, precision, recall) and the model’s performance on the test data:
- Precision: 0.71
- Recall: 0.6384
- F1-score: 0.6851

## Ethical Considerations
Address potential biases (e.g., in the data) and how these biases might affect outcomes or fairness. Note the importance of continuous monitoring.

## Caveats and Recommendations
List any warnings or constraints regarding usage of the model. Recommend updates and retraining intervals to maintain performance.
