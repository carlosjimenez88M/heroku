# Model Card: RandomForestClassifier for Income Classification

## General Description
This model is a RandomForestClassifier trained on census data to predict whether a person’s income is `>50K` or `<=50K` per year. It is trained with the `train_model.py` script and uses both categorical and numerical features.

## Intended Use
- Assess an individual’s income level based on demographic and work-related information.
- Serve as an example of an MLOps pipeline for a binary classification task.

## Data
- Source: Census dataset (`census.csv`).
- Categorical and numerical columns are processed.
- The target column is `salary`, with two categories: `>50K` and `<=50K`.

## Training
- Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier (n_estimators=100, random_state=42).
- The dataset is split 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- Main metrics include F1-Score, along with precision and recall.

## Performance
- Estimated performance on the test set (example values):
  - Precision: ~
  - Recall: ~
  - F1 score: ~
  
(Exact values can be found in the console output after training.)

## Limitations
- The model is based on census data from a specific region and time period.
- Biases may exist in the original data (e.g., selection, underrepresentation).
- No thorough bias or fairness analysis has been conducted.

## Ethical Considerations
- May amplify biases if used for high-stakes decisions (e.g., hiring or lending).
- Regular monitoring and updates are recommended to prevent inadvertent discrimination.

## Model Version
- Trained with `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.
- Generated by the `train_model.py` script.
